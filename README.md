# Switch theme button
This repository contains a button to switch the theme of an application or website. The button allows you to toggle between two modes: light mode and dark mode. Here's a preview of both modes:

### Light Mode
When you select the light mode, the interface of your application or website brightens up with a fresh and vibrant color scheme, perfect for daytime lighting conditions."

### Dark mode
On the other hand, when you opt for the dark mode, the interface changes to a softer and visually pleasing appearance, perfect for low-light environments or for those who prefer a more relaxed aesthetic.
